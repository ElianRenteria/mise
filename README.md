# mise

> *everything in its place*

mise is a voice-first cooking app that guides you through recipes completely hands-free. Just tell Bruno, your AI sous chef, what ingredients you have, and he'll find recipes and walk you through cooking step by step.

## what it does

**talk, don't tap** — control everything with your voice so you never have to touch your phone with messy hands

**find recipes from what you have** — tell Bruno your ingredients and he'll suggest dishes you can actually make

**step-by-step guidance** — Bruno walks you through each step, waiting for you to finish before moving on

**remembers your preferences** — mention you're vegetarian or hate cilantro and Bruno will remember for next time

**pick up where you left off** — phone died mid-recipe? rejoin and continue exactly where you stopped

**save your favorites** — keep track of recipes you loved and make them again anytime

## meet bruno

Bruno is your friendly raccoon sous chef. He's organized, encouraging, and genuinely loves helping people cook. He'll find recipes that work with what you have, guide you through the cooking process, and celebrate with you when the dish is done.
