# mise

> *everything in its place*

mise is a voice-first cooking assistant designed for the reality of being in the kitchen — when your hands are covered in flour, you're juggling timers, and the last thing you want to do is touch your phone.

## the problem

cooking apps today expect you to scroll through recipes, tap through steps, and constantly interact with your screen. but when you're actually cooking, your hands are busy. you're chopping, stirring, measuring. you don't want to wash your hands every time you need to check the next step.

## the solution

mise gives you a sous chef in your pocket. just talk to Bruno — tell him what ingredients you have, and he'll suggest what you can make. pick a recipe, and he'll walk you through it step by step, waiting for you to finish each one before moving on. no tapping, no scrolling, no touching your phone with messy hands.

## features

### voice-first interaction
the entire experience is designed around conversation. ask Bruno what you can make with chicken and rice. tell him you're done chopping. ask him to repeat that last step. it all just works.

### ingredient-based recipe discovery
don't start with a recipe and go shopping — start with what you have. tell Bruno your ingredients and he'll find recipes that actually work with what's in your kitchen, minimizing what you need to buy.

### step-by-step guidance
Bruno gives you one step at a time and waits for you to finish before moving on. no more accidentally scrolling past where you were or losing your place. just say "done" or "next" when you're ready.

### preference memory
mention that you're vegetarian, allergic to nuts, or hate cilantro — Bruno remembers. next time you cook, he'll automatically filter out recipes that don't work for you. your preferences persist across sessions.

### session continuity
phone died? wifi dropped? no problem. come back and Bruno picks up exactly where you left off. he knows what recipe you were making and what step you were on.

### favorites
loved a recipe? save it to your favorites and make it again anytime. rate your dishes and build your personal cookbook.

### kitchen history
every cooking session is saved. look back at what you've made, when you made it, and how it went.

## meet bruno

Bruno is your AI sous chef — a friendly raccoon who genuinely loves helping people cook. he's named after the French culinary concept "mise en place" (everything in its place), and he embodies that philosophy: organized, prepared, and ready to help.

he's not a robot reading instructions. he's conversational, encouraging, and adapts to how you cook. he'll give you tips, wait patiently while you prep, and celebrate with you when the dish comes together.

## design principles

**hands-free by default**
every interaction can be completed with voice. the UI exists for moments when you want to glance at something, not as the primary interface.

**one thing at a time**
no overwhelming recipe walls. one step, one instruction, one moment at a time.

**remember everything**
preferences, history, favorites, session state — mise remembers so you don't have to.

**meet people where they are**
whether you're a beginner or experienced cook, whether you have a full pantry or three random ingredients, mise adapts.
